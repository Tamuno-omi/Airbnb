## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I decided to take a look at the airbnb dataset provided for the city on http://insideairbnb.com/, and see how I can gain various insights like:

1) What are the various room types listed on Airbnb in Capetown.
2) What are the most popular property types in the city.
3) What is the average price for the various room types.
4) A look at availibility of Listings in a year.
5) How many percent of listings are superhosts.



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a single notebook available here to showcase my work related to the above questions. It is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](insert medium link).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the insideairbnb link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
